# Microsoft Fabric CI/CD using GitHub Actions – Comprehensive Documentation

## 1. Overview and Scope

This documentation outlines a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) strategy for deploying Microsoft Fabric artifacts like Notebooks, Pipelines, Lakehouses, and Data Warehouses using GitHub Actions. It is aimed at Data Engineers, DevOps Engineers, and Fabric Administrators managing scalable data platforms.

### Supported Artifacts

- Notebooks (.ipynb)  
- Pipelines (.json)  
- Lakehouses (.json)  
- Warehouses (SQL .sql scripts)  

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Fabric CLI / REST API  
- GitHub Actions  
- GitHub Secrets  
- `parameter.yml` for configuration  

---

## 2. Architecture Diagram

> **Note:** Add a visual separately using tools like draw.io, Visio, or PlantUML.

**Components to show:**

- Git push triggers GitHub Actions workflows
- Fabric CLI interacts with Fabric API using secrets
- parameter.yml provides environment-specific configurations
- Deployment flows into Dev → QA → Production Fabric workspaces

---

## 3. Prerequisites

### Fabric Environment

- Contributor/Admin access to target Fabric workspaces  
- Active Fabric capacity or subscription license  
- Artifacts (notebooks, pipelines, lakehouses) pre-published or stored in Git  

### GitHub Setup

- GitHub Repository enabled with CI workflows and Secrets  
- GitHub Secrets required:

  ```
  FABRIC_CLIENT_ID
  FABRIC_CLIENT_SECRET
  FABRIC_TENANT_ID
  FABRIC_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
  FABRIC_WORKSPACE_ID
  ```

#### Versions

- Ensure tools used are compatible with your Fabric workspace version  
- Document currently used versions of CLI/tools internally

```

## 5. Branching and Git Strategy

### Branch Flow

```
feature/* → develop → release/* → main
```

| Branch       | Purpose              | Workspace Mapping     |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| feature/*    | Individual changes   | Developer workspaces   |
| develop      | Shared integration   | Dev Workspace          |
| release/*    | Pre-production QA    | Stage/QA Workspace     |
| main         | Production deployment| Production Workspace   |

### Pull Request Process

- PR to develop: workflow performs linting and validation  
- Merge to release/*: triggers deployment to QA  
- Merge to main: deploys to Production  

---

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline Workflows

### Fabric Artifact Deployment Workflow

Handles:

- Pipelines, Notebooks, Lakehouses  
- Uses Fabric CLI and `parameter.yml` values  

### Data Warehouse Deployment Workflow

Handles:

- SQL scripts for tables, views, stored procedures  
- Executed on warehouse endpoints  

Sample GitHub Step:

```
- name: Setup Python & Install CLI
  run: |
    pip install fabric-cicd
    fabric login --service-principal
```

---

## 7. Parameterization using `parameter.yml`

### Purpose

- To externalize configuration per environment  
- Avoid hardcoded workspace, file paths or IDs  

### Sample

```
environment: qa
workspace_id: xxxxxxxx
notebooks:
  - name: example-notebook
    path: notebooks/example-notebook.ipynb

pipelines:
  - name: example-pipeline
    path: pipelines/example-pipeline.json
```

---

## 8. Deployment Strategy

| Stage  | Purpose            | Trigger               |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Dev    | Developer Testing  | Manual/feature branch |
| QA     | Integration Testing| Push to release/*     |
| Prod   | Final Deployment   | Merge to main         |

### Trigger Strategy

- PR to develop: validation only  
- Push to release/*: deploy to QA  
- Push to main: deploy to Production  

---

## 9. Developing Pipelines

- Design modular pipelines: ingest, transform, export  
- Parameterize connections, environment IDs  
- Add retry logic with back-off  
- Use notebook/pipeline templates for reusability  
- Fail fast using schema or null checks early in flow  

---

## 10. Developing Notebooks

### Recommended Structure

1. Title and description  
2. Setup (libraries, input sources)  
3. Load data  
4. Processing and transformation  
5. Save/export logic  
6. Summary or validation  

### Best Practices

- Use Markdown cells for documentation  
- Strip outputs from notebooks before committing  
- Test logic externally using facilitated Python modules  
- Avoid unnecessary hardcoding—use parameters  

---

## 11. CI Validation Steps

- YAML/JSON schema validation  
- File and path validation  
- Notebook linting with `nbQA`, `flake8`  
- `dry-run` deployment checks  
- Deployment authentication tests  

---

## 12. Artifact Deployment Matrix

| Artifact  | Format   | Deployment Method | Notes                          |
|-----------|----------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Notebook  | .ipynb   | CLI or REST API    | Strip outputs before committing |
| Pipeline  | .json    | CLI or REST API    | Validate schema and dependencies |
| Lakehouse | .json    | CLI or script      | Ensure workspace and dependencies exist |
| Warehouse | .sql     | SQL engine         | Keep DDL and DML separate |

---

## 13. Troubleshooting

| Error             | Cause                     | Resolution                           |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Wrong secret or expired   | Regenerate and update GitHub Secrets |
| Not Found        | Invalid path in config    | Double-check `parameter.yml`         |
| Partial Sync     | Mismatch workspace ID     | Reconfirm environment ID             |
| Timeout/Errors   | Large deployments         | Batch or increase resource size      |

---

## 14. Change Log and Versioning

- Maintain `CHANGELOG.md`  
- Git tag releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`)  
- Incorporate commit SHA in validations  
- Use semantic versioning  

---

## 15. Monitoring & Observability

- Export logs from GitHub Actions  
- Set up workflow-level notification (Teams/Slack/email)  
- Capture stdout/stderr into deployment logs  
- Integrate with Azure Monitor if applicable  

---

## 16. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests in Python for transformation logic  
- Use test datasets (anonymized, sanitized)  
- Automate notebook executions with assertions  
- Validate SQL execution outputs in QA  

---

## 17. Security & Compliance

- Use GitHub Secrets and secret masking  
- Secure Fabric API keys with RBAC  
- Rotate secrets periodically  
- Don’t allow hardcoded credentials or workspace IDs  

---

## 18. Cost & Performance Optimization

- Use minimal compute in dev environments  
- Consolidate repeatable jobs into reusable logic  
- Monitor workspace quotas & warehouse usage  
- Tag resources for cost tracking  

---

## 19. Disaster Recovery

- Backup notebooks and pipelines often  
- Maintain JSON/SQL exports for all artifacts  
- Automate rollback deployments using tags  
- Store environment snapshots via Git  

---
